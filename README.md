# ðŸŽµ Spotify SQL Simulation

This project is a simple simulation of how Spotify might use SQL to store and manage user data behind the scenes. I imagined what the database might look like for tracking saved songs in a userâ€™s library.

I created a table to store song info, added some example data, and wrote SQL statements that show how songs might be updated or deletedâ€”like if a user edits the title of a track or removes it from their library.

This was done as part of Khan Academyâ€™s SQL practice projects to help build foundational SQL skills.
